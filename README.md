# Tianchengfinal

The `Tianchengfinal` package is built to explore  the impact of word embedding dimensions in neural network language models, as proposed in the seminal work of Bengio et al. [1].This package offers a set of functions for data preprocessing, model training, simulation, and visualization.

# Installation and Examples

Please refer to the [vignette](https://github.com/TianchengY/Tianchengfinal/blob/master/vignette/Vignette.pdf) for more details. 

# Run Experiment in Colab

Given the complex dependencies associated with the TensorFlow package for R, it is highly recommended to execute the toy experiment on Google Colab. Colab conveniently has all the necessary dependencies pre-installed for users.

Here is a **[link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_vvFpamWUa-SwXFUlJpkFxD9yx_YXAxR?usp=sharing)** to a publicly shared Google Colab notebook where you can easily execute the provided code. Alternatively, you could also create a new notebook in your own Google Colab environment and follow the instructions in the [vignette](https://github.com/TianchengY/Tianchengfinal/blob/master/vignette/Vignette.pdf).
